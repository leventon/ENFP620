### ENFP 620 - The University of Maryland Graduate Fire Dynamics Laboratory

##### Course Objectives
This course is designed to give students hands on experience with various live fire experiments to reinforce their understanding of key fire behaviors. Key physical relationships (theory) governing these behaviors will first be developed and presented in lecture format, with emphasis on application to fundamental fire scenarios. 

Students will perform experiments, quantify their observations through measurements, and critically analyze the measurement data from both in-person and virtual fire experiments. The experiments are designed to reinforce fire science principles, explore the accuracy of theoretical relationships, and familiarize students with standard fire measurement and analysis techniques.

Through these laboratories, related lectures, and in-person data analysis sessions, students will also be introduced to and practice working with key scientific applications: 
- MATLAB (a programming language and numeric computing environment that allows for importing, plotting, and analysis of data, implementation of algorithms, and creation of models and applications), and 
- LaTeX (the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents with features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation)


##### Course Content
Laboratory experiments are designed to illustrate fire phenomena and test theoretical models. Approximately 7 virtual and in-person laboratory analyses (and related uncertainty quantifications) will be performed, focusing on: 
- Generation & Characterization of firebrands 
- Diffusion flames & Flame structure
- Fire spread through vegetative fuels (i.e., wildfire flame spread)
- Temperature & Heat flux measurements
- Liquid pool fires & Fire plumes
- Flame spread over solids
- Material flammability experiments (e.g., cone calorimeter, gasification, FPA; TGA, DSC, and MCC).
