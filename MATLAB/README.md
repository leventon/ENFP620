### Working With MATLAB
Like any language, there is no better way to learn MATLAB than through continuous practice. If you have used MATLAB before, but would like a refresher or some practice, I encourage you to work on the FPE MATLAB Primer available on this Github repository. 
- Using online resources and/or textbooks is encouraged (and something that every coder ever, everywhere, does) but you will not learn a language by just copying someone else’s lines.
- Practice, fail, tweak things until they work/make sense… make some progress

If you have never used MATLAB (or any programming language before) and/or think “I really have no idea what I’m doing, MATLAB is the devil. Why would you do this to me?” I strongly encourage you to first complete the [MATLAB Onramp Tutorial](https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html)
